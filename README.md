### ℹ️ About this project 
- 📚 This project is a team project as a part of the `CPE112` `Programming with Data Structure`, Computer Engineering, KMUTT
- 🎯 The objective is to implement knowledge in data structures to create real-world applications that align with our interests.
  - In this work, we're inspired by [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pac-Man_video_games), which has a maze with only one absolute path. Therefore, we want to create an application to generate maze paths randomly.

### 💡 Technical Concept 
- 🏃🏻 Maze path generation using the [Randomize Depth First Search Algorithm](https://www.algosome.com/articles/maze-generation-depth-first.html) : `Randomized DFS`
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Implemented in `C programming`  
- 📦 Data Structure:
  -  Graph Representation: `Adjacency List`
  -  Randomized DFS: `Stack`
- 🤖 Additional Features
    - simple User Interface (UI) using the concept of ASCII art 
    - Load and export maze data in `.txt` format
